# `qsp-functions.heta`

The `qsp-functions.heta` file serves as a container for additional custom functions that can be used within Heta platforms. 

## Overview

- **Location:** This file is automatically generated when you run the `heta init` command and can be found in the `src` directory of your project.
- **Integration:** A reference to this file is included in the `index.heta` file, ensuring these functions are available within your Heta project.

## Defining Custom Functions

Heta provides the flexibility to define your own functions. For details on how to create custom functions, refer to the [`#defineFunction`](/specifications/actions?id=definefunction) specification.

## Included Functions

The `qsp-functions.heta` file contains a curated list of additional functions specifically tailored for Heta platforms. These functions are not part of the [base function list](/specifications/math?id=list-of-functions), but they extend the platform's functionality. 

## Best Practices

2. Organize new functions in dedicated files or include them in the main `index.heta` for better maintainability.
3. Keep the `qsp-functions.heta` file intact to ensure a consistent and predictable setup for your project.
